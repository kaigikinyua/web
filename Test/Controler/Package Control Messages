  Deprecated Icon Fonts
  =====================
  
  This is a reminder that as of v3.0.0 several icon fonts have been removed from
  this package:
  
  - Elegant Theme Line Icons
  - Foundation Icons 1.0
  - Glyphicons Filetypes
  - Glyphicons Halflings
  - Glyphicons Pro

  If you need support for any of the removed icons, you can install the separate
